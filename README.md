My take on Derek Banas' Tutorial on investing with data science!

Check his tutorial on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jaBKXDqg9U

Here I have the files I created while I followed the tutorial. 
They are a "traditional" python files, instead of Jupyter notebooks (what he uses) which is better for explaining.

I still want to do some stuff (I have added TODO's) and commented some other parts that were not clear to me at the moment
