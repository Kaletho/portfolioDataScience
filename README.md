My take on Derek Banas' Tutorial on investing with data science!

Check his tutorial on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jaBKXDqg9U

Here I have the files I created while I followed the tutorial.
They are not exactly the same (although really similar). I wrote them as I tried to understand how everything worked

I still want to implement some changes to the portfolio optimization file. I'll upload it once I'm done
